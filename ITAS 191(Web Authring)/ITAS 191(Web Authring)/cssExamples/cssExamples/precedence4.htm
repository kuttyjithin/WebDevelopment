	<h1 class="greentitle">Forest elephants</h1>
   	<p>In this section, we discuss the <em> lesser</em> known forest elephants. Are not all elephants, to a degree, lesser known? I mean, who among us can really say we know any elephants well? I suppose we all had that elephant we knew at the zoo, as a kid.</p>
	<h1>Non-Forest Elephants</h1>
	<p>Obviously, not all elephants live in the forest; thus, the Non-Forest Elephant.</p>
