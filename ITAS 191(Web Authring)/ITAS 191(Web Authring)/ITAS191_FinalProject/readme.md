W3C Valdiation

SOLVED:  most of the errors expect some warning and errors

Error: Duplicate ID right.

From line 72, column 29; to line 72, column 44

          <div id="right">↩     

I could not solve this error.I think that the error may be because of the repetation of the id in the different place.
